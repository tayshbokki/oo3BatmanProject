BATMAN's Proposal

Members: Alabado, Taraya, and Yano

Project Title: Sustainable Seekers 

Theme: SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

Sustainable Seekers is a Java-based 2D game that challenges players to navigate through an eco-friendly virtual city by finding the shortest routes to sustainable locations while overcoming obstacles and collecting 
rewards. Using sustainable transportation options like walking, cycling, or public transportation, players explore the city, tackle challenges, and learn about the benefits of eco-friendly travel. 

Additional Features:
• Interactive map
• Level progression 
• Obstacle challenges
